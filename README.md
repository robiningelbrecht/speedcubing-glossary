## B

***Beginner&#039;s method***: A beginner&#039;s method refers to speedsolving methods designed for beginners, which often have many steps to simplify the process.

***BLD***: Blindfolded speedcubing - refers to solving cubes blindfolded.

***BLE***: Brooks&#039; Last Edge. These algorithms insert an edge into your your last F2L slot and orient the corners of the last layer.

***Blockbuilding***: Blockbuilding generally refers to inuitively solving blocks of pieces around the cube, in contrast to algorithmic speedcubing approaches.


## C

***Center***: Refers to the middle piece on each side of a Rubik&#039;s cube. For bigger cubes, it refers to the pieces with only one colour.

***Centre piece***: A centre piece is a piece, or pieces resp., in the middle of a cube.

***CFOP***: The most common speedsolving method, which solves the cube in the following sequence: Cross-F2L-OLL-PLL

***CLL***: Corners of Last Layer. These algorithms solve the corners of the last layer, as their name suggests.

***CLS***: Corner Last Slot. CLS algorithms solve the last F2L corner and orient your last layer at the same time. They are used when the edge of your final F2L pair is already solved, and the last layer edges are oriented.

***COLL***: Corners and Orientation of Last Layer. COLL algorithms are used to orient and permute the corners of your last layer at the same time.

***Colour Neutrality***: The solver is able to create the cross on any colour, and therefore has 6 different options for cross to pick from

***Commutator***: A sequence of moves of the form A-B-A&#039;-B&#039;. Example: (R&#039; D&#039; R) (U) (R&#039; D R) (U&#039;)



***Conjugate***: A  sequence of moves of the form A-B-A&#039;. Example: (R U2 R&#039;) (R&#039; F R F&#039;) (R U2 R&#039;)

***Corner***: Refers to the corner pieces on the Rubik&#039;s cube, which are the pieces with three different colours.

***Corner Twists***: Sometimes corners can twist in their place. A puzzle cannot be solved when a single corner twists in it&#039;s place

***CP***: Corner Permutation

***Cross***: The cross generally refers to correctly solving 4 edge pieces around a center piece, to form a &#039;plus&#039; or &#039;cross&#039; out of the center and edge stickers.

***Cube Rotation***: Rotating the cube in place without turning any of the sides. The three rotational axes used in cube notation are x y and z.

## D

***Devil&#039;s number***: The term devil&#039;s number refers to the number of moves required to solve a cube from any starting configuration using a single repeating algorithm. Devil&#039;s algorithm is the algorithm needed to achieve this task. To this day, neither man nor machine were able to calculate the devil&#039;s algorithm, or the devil’s number, for the 2x2 cube or the other larger models. These calculations result in an unimaginably large number of possibilities that, so far, could not be captured.

***Edge Control***: Intentionally orienting last layer edges whilst solving the first two layers.

***Face***: A single surface of a Rubik&#039;s cube.

***Fewest moves***: Fewest moves means you solve a speed cube in as few moves as possible.

***Florian Mod***: Cubes that are said to have a florian mod have curved corners to help the pieces to move more easily around each other.

***FMC***: Fewest Moves Challenge

***Fridrich Method***: Also known as CFOP, the most common speedsolving method, which solves the cube in the following sequence: Cross-F2L-OLL-PLL


## G

***God&#039;s number***: God&#039;s number, also called &quot;God&#039;s algorithm&quot;, is the minimum number of moves needed to solve a cube, regardless of the starting configuration.


## H

***Half-Turn***: Any 180 degree turn of the Rubik&#039;s cube.


## I

***Inspection***: The time used to inspect the cube before starting a solve. In WCA competitions, the maximum inspection time is 15 seconds.


## L

***Layer***: Refers to all of the pieces which make up one rotational side of a Rubik&#039;s cube.



***LBL***: Layer By Layer

***LL***: Last layer

***Lock-up / locking***: Lock-up or locking are terms used to describe when the cube jams. When a piece, one or even multiple layers are misaligned, you won’t be able to execute the turn correctly and the cube locks up. 

***Look-Ahead***: Planning future stages of a speedsolve whilst executing moves to solve the pieces of the current stage.


## M

***MagLev***: MagLev is short for magnetic levitation or magnetic levitation force, respectively. Cubes with MagLev construction have in their tensioning system two superimposed magnets whose like poles face, and thus repel, each other.

***OLL***: Orientation of Last Layer

***OLLCP***: Orientation of Last Layer + Corner Permutation

***Overshooting***: Overshooting describes a rotation that goes further than desired. For example, you intend to rotate a layer by 90 degrees, but due to high speed, it overshoots and turns 180 degrees instead.


## P

***Parity***: Parity in a speedsolving context generally refers to additional steps required to solve a puzzle in cases where there are (or appear to be) an odd number of piece swaps on a cube.

***PB***: If a speedcuber solves a puzzle faster than they have ever done before, it is known as a PB or personal best.

***Petrus Method***: A 3x3 speedsolving method developed by Lars Petrus which has a strong emphasis on blockbuilding.

***PLL***: Permutation of Last Layer

***Popping***: Since the pieces of a cube can move around it is possible for them to pop out completely. It can be caused by loose tensions, rough turning, or be result of the mechanism that is used in a specific puzzle.


## Q

***Quarter Turn***: Any 90 degree turn of the Rubik&#039;s cube.


## R

***Reduction***: A common big cube solving method whereby the cuber solves the center pieces into place, followed by pairing up edge pieces to effectively &#039;reduce&#039; the big cube to a 3x3.

***Roux***: A 3x3 speedsolving method developed by Gilles Roux in which 1x2x3 blocks are built on the left and right sides of the cube to begin the solve.


## S

***Scramble***: A scramble is another simple term that consists of 20 randomly generated moves in standard notation that will leave the cube in an unsolved state ready for a solver to attempt

## Z

***ZBF2L***: Zborowski-Bruchem First 2 Layers. These algorithms solve the final F2L pair and orient the edges of the last layer to set up for ZBLL.
