<kbd>CLL</kbd>: Corners of Last Layer. These algorithms solve the corners of the last layer, as their name suggests.

<kbd>CLS</kbd>: Corner Last Slot. CLS algorithms solve the last F2L corner and orient your last layer at the same time. They are used when the edge of your final F2L pair is already solved, and the last layer edges are oriented.

<kbd>COLL</kbd>: Corners and Orientation of Last Layer. COLL algorithms are used to orient and permute the corners of your last layer at the same time.

## D

<kbd>Devil&#039;s number</kbd>: The term devil&#039;s number refers to the number of moves required to solve a cube from any starting configuration using a single repeating algorithm. Devil&#039;s algorithm is the algorithm needed to achieve this task. To this day, neither man nor machine were able to calculate the devil&#039;s algorithm, or the devil’s number, for the 2x2 cube or the other larger models. These calculations result in an unimaginably large number of possibilities that, so far, could not be captured.

<kbd>Quarter Turn</kbd>: Any 90 degree turn of the Rubik&#039;s cube.


## R

<kbd>Reduction</kbd>: A common big cube solving method whereby the cuber solves the center pieces into place, followed by pairing up edge pieces to effectively &#039;reduce&#039; the big cube to a 3x3.
